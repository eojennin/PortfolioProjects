  Using data downloaded from ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, I analyzed a few different 
  aspects of Covid Deaths vs Covid Vaccinations using Aggregate Functions, JOINS and CTE's.
  
  

  --Selecting data that we will be using
  
  Select location, date, total_cases, new_cases, population
  FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
  ORDER BY 1,2
  

-- Looking at total cases vs total deaths

 Select location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
  FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
  WHERE location = 'United States'
  ORDER BY 1,2
  
-- Looking at total cases vs population

 SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopInfected
 FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
 WHERE location = 'United States'
 ORDER BY 1,2

-- Looking at countries with highest infection rate compaired to population

 SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestCaseNum, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopInfected
 FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
 group by 1,2
 ORDER BY PercentPopInfected DESC

-- Showing countries with highest Death Count per Population

 SELECT location, MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
 FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
 WHERE continent is not null 
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC

 -- Let's break this down by Continent

SELECT continent , MAX(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
WHERE continent is not null 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC

--Global Numbers

Select date, SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(new_deaths) as total_deaths, SUM(new_deaths)/Sum(new_cases)*100 as Death_Percentage
FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths`
Where continent is not null
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1,2

--Let's join in the Vaccination data

Select *
FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths` dea
    JOIN `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Vaccinations`vac
    ON dea.location = vac.location 
    and dea.date = vac.date

-- Looking at total population vs Vaccinations

Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths` dea
    JOIN `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Vaccinations`vac
    ON dea.location = vac.location 
    and dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent is not null
order by 2,3

--Use a CTE to find percent Vaccinated

WITH PopvsVac as 
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Deaths` dea
    JOIN `imposing-voyage-343815.COVID_Data.COVID_Vaccinations`vac
    ON dea.location = vac.location 
    and dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent is not null
)
Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 as Percent_Vaccinated
From PopvsVac
